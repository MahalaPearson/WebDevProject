                    <p class="lead mb-5 new">From a beautifully rainy and ever-green state called Washington, 
                        I (Mahala Pearson) moved to Utah to attend Brigham Young University. I left my two adorable younger brothers, Sean and Ronan, back home. 
                        I moved here to pruse my career in Accounting and continue to serve in the Army National Guard. I participate in one of the Nations 
                        best ROTC programs here at BYU, as well as train on a Nationally Ranked Ranger Challenge Team. Since moving to Utah, I have developed my own family 
                        on the Ranger Challenge Team, proud to call each one of them my bothers and sisters. I have done and experienced 
                        many things in my short life, from being an alter server, a wrestler all the way to producing videos and writting articles for my high school. 
                        I take any opportunity given to me with graditude and I firmly believe in no matter what you do putting forth 100 percent effort. I do not believe in wasting the 
                        life given to me because of fear or uncertainty.</p>

                            which can be a book full of metaphors and epiphanies, or better a simple book about a small ordinary town.

                            I stress bake like most. Why I love baking instead of cooking is that all you need
                            is flour, sugar, salt, and some sort of fat (butter, shortining) to make a multitude of different things!
                            Cooking is more of an art, while baking is just a stress relieving chemistry project.

                            It is easier than it looks and sounds. Key rule (really the only rule) is don't breathe in!
                            Fire has an oddly charming and calming heat.

                            Rucking is just hiking or walking with a REALLY heavy backpack. I love it. My best 6-mile was done at an 11 min pace,
                            finishing at 66 min total. Unfortunately it can be hard on your hips, knees, and back. I recently fractured my tibula, fibula, and
                            patella when doing Ruck sprints with my Ranger Challenge Team. However, that said I honestly can't wait to get back to it!

                            I've been weightlifting for 5 years. It is cathartic. My favorite lift is deadllifting upon which I have
                            finally reach 240! Weightlifting helps me during finals, and other unhappy times within my life.

                            This is a topic close to my heart. While in the U.S., education is often taken for granted. There are many countries where education is a gift. While many contries allow men to be educated women never are.
                            You will often see that some countries will allow women to recieve basic elementary education, but never be allowed to pursue a career. After this "formal education" is recieved women/young girls are rushed home to do 
                            house keeping. I am always aware of the educational privileges I have just because I was born in the U.S. I seek to travel and help educate women who want to pursue anytype of career. I also would like to 
                            setup a scholarship that will allow young women from under educated countries to come here and study whatever they would like in order to have a better life.
